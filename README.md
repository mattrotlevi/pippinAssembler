# PIPPIN Assembler 

This is a PIPPIN Assembler written in Java for a school final project. It is an assembler that takes in .pasm files, reads it in and catches errors either with the mneumonic or the syntax. 

If there are no errors it compiles the .pasm file to a .pexe, runs the executable, and displays the memory contents throughtout execution step by step.
